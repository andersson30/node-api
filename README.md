# Api Rest Node.js 

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer and is used to access and manipulate data using several stateless operations. These operations are integral to the HTTP protocol and represent an essential CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

The HTTP operations available are:

POST (create a resource or generally provide data)
GET (retrieve an index of resources or an individual resource)
PUT (create or replace a resource)
PATCH (update/modify a resource)
DELETE (remove a resource)
